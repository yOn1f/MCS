# Operations on finite automata (L2 EFREI Paris)

This project is given in second year at EFREI Paris as part of the Maths For Computer Science subject.
The aim is to implement several operations on finite automata (for more information on finite automata, [click here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-finite-automata/)).

## What operations are to be implemented and what are the requirements?

Every technical specification is detailed [here](https://github.com/yOn1f/MCS/blob/master/Subject.pdf) in the subject.

Original automaton:
Initial states: 0
Final states: 7
Transitions: 
0*1
0*4

6*7

This automaton has epsilon transitions (0*1, 0*4, 1*3, 3*7, 6*4, 6*7). It is asynchronous.
This automaton has several transitions labeled with the same symbol. It is not deterministic.
State 0 doesn't have at least 1 transition by symbol in the alphabet so this FA is not complete.

Original automaton:
Initial states: 0 4
Final states: 0 3

This automaton has epsilon transitions (2*1). It is asynchronous.
This automaton has more than one entry (states 0, 4). It is not deterministic.
State 1 doesn't have at least 1 transition by symbol in the alphabet so this FA is not complete.
